First of all thank you, that you would like to help improving this action.  

Opening a bug report, you already tried to solve this issue yourself and can give detailed information in the underlying template. In this way everybody can benefit from this improvement.  

If you just came here because you want to have a one-on-one configuration session, please consider contacting me directly, as my PayPal is wide open. I don't run this as a business. So all the money gained by this will go directly to https://www.welthungerhilfe.org . In this way I will add the improvement for everybody for you.
